<h1>Our Data</h1>
<strong>The World Happiness Report:</strong>

“Ladder”, or happiness score or subjective well-being, is sourced from the February 2024 release of the Gallup World Poll. Unless stated otherwise, it is the national average response to the question of life evaluations. The exact wording of the question asked to participants is as follows: “Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you
stand at this time?”

“gdp”, or GDP per capita statistics in purchasing power parity at constant 2017 international dollar prices are from the World Development Indicators (WDI, version 23, Metadata last updated on Sep 27, 2023). THe GDP figures for Taiwan, Syria, Palestinian Territories, Venezuela, Djbouti, and Yemen are from the Penn World Table 10.01

Healthy Life Expectancy (HLE) is based on the data extracted from the World Health Organization’s Global Health Observatory data repository. The data at the source are available for the years 2000, 2010, 2015 and 2019. To match this report’s sample period, interpolation and extrapolation are used.

Social support (or having someone to count on in times of trouble) is the national average of the binary responses (either 0 or 1) to the Gallup World Poll question “If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?”

Freedom to make life choices is the national average of responses to the Gallup World Poll question “Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?”

Generosity is the residual of regressing national average of responses to the Gallup World Poll question “Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?” on GDP per capita.

Corruption Perception is the national average of the survey responses to two questions in the Gallup World Poll: “Is corruption widespread throughout the government or not” and “Is corruption widespread within businesses or not?” The overall perception is just the average of the two 0-or-1 responses. In case the perception of government corruption is missing, the perception of business corruption as the overall perception is used. The corruption perception at the national level is just the average response of the overall perception at the individual level. 

Positive affect is defined as the average of three positive affect measures in Gallup World Poll: laugh, enjoyment and doing interesting things in the Gallup World Poll. These measures are the responses to the following three questions, respectively: “Did you smile or laugh a lot yesterday?”, and “Did you experience the following feelings during A LOT OF THE DAY yesterday? How about Enjoyment?”, “Did you learn or do something interesting yesterday?”
Negative affect is defined as the average of three negative affect measures in Gallup World Poll. They are worry, sadness and anger, respectively the responses to “Did you experience the following feelings during A LOT OF THE DAY yesterday? How about Worry?”, “Did you experience the following feelings during A LOT OF THE DAY yesterday? How about Sadness?”, and “Did you experience the following feelings during A LOT OF THE DAY yesterday? How about Anger?” 

Institutional trust: The first principal component of the following five measures: confidence in the national government, confidence in the judicial system and courts, confidence in the honesty of elections, confidence in the local police force, and perceived corruption in business. This principal component is then used to create a binary measure of high institutional trust using the 75th percentile in the global distribution as the cutoff point; this way a country whose population tends to have a low level of institutional trust in the global distribution will have a low average institutional trust at the national level. This measure is not available for all countries since not all surveys in all countries ask all of the questions that are used to derive the principal component. 


<strong>Mental State of the World Data:</strong>

This project/dataset utilizes the Mental Health Quotient, or MHQ, which captures perceptions of 47 aspects of mental capability and functioning on a life impact scale. The MHQ assessment is offered as an online anonymous survey that takes approximately 15 minutes to complete and provides respondents with a comprehensive report with tailored self-care and help-seeking recommendations via email. It also delivers a score (the MHQ) that positions individuals on a spectrum from Distressed to Thriving. This score has been demonstrated to relate systematically to productivity in work and life as well as clinical burden. Six dimensional scores of Mood & Outlook, Social Self, Drive & Motivation, Adaptability & Resilience, Cognition, and Mind-Body Connection are also computed using subsets of the 47 assessed items to provide a more granular view. The scores are reported on a scale that is divided into positive and negative components. The positive range of the scale represents the spectrum of normal functioning and is a 200-point scale calibrated to a mean of 100 based on pre-pandemic responses in 2019, similar to the IQ scale. The negative range of the scale represents mental wellbeing scores associated with a negative impact on the ability to function and is associated with clinical level risks and challenges.
